# MazeProblem
Implemented Maze problem using Genetic Algorithm
Problem Definition: You are going to solve a maze problem using Genetic Algorithm. The aim of this task  is to find a path in a maze, shown in the figure below, for a mouse to reach the destination or food with a  shortest and acceptable path. You are going to implement a Genetic Algorithm that will find the solution  to find the path by optimizing the problem automatically.
